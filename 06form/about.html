        <p>Hi! My name is Lauren, I'm the face behind Lauren's Plants. I hope you have fun exploring my website and get to learn more about one of my biggest passions. I started collecting houseplants when I was in high school, mostly just succentlents and the like. When I moved away for collge in Utah, my collection just grew. I've had all different types and sizes of plants, some of which I've loved and others that I did not. Through much trial and error I have created a lush jungle-like environment in my home filled with luscious greenery, and I want to help you do the same. I have narrowed down some of my favorite <a href="https://plantproper.com/collections/plants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plant shops</a> you can purchase plants from as well. Thanks for being here!</p>
